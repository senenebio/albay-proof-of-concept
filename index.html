Executive Summary:
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this proposal is to conduct a skills mapping survey in the whole province of ALBAY in order to identify the skills and expertise present within the local community. This information will be useful for a variety of stakeholders, including local businesses, economic development organizations, educational institutions, and job seekers.
</p>
<p>
Methodology:
</p>
<p>
The skills mapping survey will be conducted using a combination of online and in-person methods. Online methods will include the use of a survey tool, such as Google Forms or SurveyMonkey, to collect responses from a representative sample of the population. In-person methods will involve interviews with key informants, such as business owners, community leaders, and educators.
</p>
<p>
The survey will ask respondents to identify their skills and expertise, as well as any training or education they have received in those areas. It will also ask about their employment status, job preferences, and any barriers to employment they may be facing.
</p>
<p>
Data Analysis:
</p>
<p>
The collected data will be analyzed using statistical software, such as R, Python, Excel or SPSS, to identify patterns and trends in the skills and expertise present within the community. The results of the analysis will be presented in the form of a report, including recommendations for how the information can be used to support economic development and workforce development in the small city.
</p>
<p>
Timeline:
</p>
<p>
The skills mapping survey is expected to take approximately 3 months to complete, including data collection, analysis, and report writing.
</p>
<p>
Budget:
</p>
<p>
The budget for this project is Php 000,000, which includes the cost of hiring staff to conduct the survey, purchasing any necessary software or equipment, and producing the final report.
</p>
<p>
Conclusion:
</p>
<p>
Conducting a skills mapping survey in the province will provide valuable information about the skills and expertise present within the local community. This information can be used to support economic development and workforce development efforts, and will be of interest to a variety of stakeholders. We believe that this project represents a worthwhile investment of time and resources, and we look forward to working with you to make it a success.
